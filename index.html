<h1>Plot Summary</h1>

<p>A lot of text here was cut, to see if the story holds without my preamble explaining certain overarching details.</p>

<p>This is a first first first draft of the general story I have in mind for a game I want to make at some point in my life.</p>

<p>This is basically a transcription of a dimly remembered plot summary from one morning at work where I just conjured the entire plot, beat for beat.</p>

<p>I have not checked this for grammar, spelling or even consistent terminology. This is a complete fucking mess.</p>

<p>It is influenced by Chrono Trigger, Octopath Traveler and Dragon Quest 11. The initial seed for this story began to grow in 2015, after seeing Star Wars: TFA and wanting to make a ‘Cyberspace Opera’, like how Star Wars is a ‘Space Opera’.</p>

<p>Later, when playing Kingdom Hearts, I noticed a number of similarities. However, I absolutely did not play KH before early 2019 in any real way.</p>

<p>Synopsis (Draft 1.2)</p>

<p>First, a fundamental aspect of the setting:</p>

<p>OMNI is accessed through Digital Dream Interfaces, which inject the virtual world into lucid dreaming via Brain-Computer Interfaces. As lucid dreams can be controlled by thought, Digital Dream Interfaces inject software imperceptibly into a lucid dream state. As lucid dreams feel real, this takes a lot of effort off the computer in terms of generating sensations etc.</p>

<p>Users can live their entire lives in this state, the software can also control sleepwalking to some extent, allowing users to do everything their physical form needs to survive without ever leaving OMNI.</p>

<p>This will become important later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Disc 1</h2>

<p><strong>There needs to be a stronger intro, there is literally no point setting up, even from a dramatic irony sense, a &#39;matrix reveal&#39; with Mirai. The story is called Digital Dream and is conspicuously set in Cyberspace from the outside. The reveal and explanation in The Matrix was because at release, it was mysterious and a cool twist. Therefore, the story MAY revive ideas from way back (2015) regarding a &#39;R2D2 and 3PO Escape Pod Open&#39; with the Celeb Bot (Note 28022021) Celeb Bot Concept was rolled to ’character from something’ as using an actual person breaches ‘Ethical Regulations’ in my mind</strong></p>

<p>Mirai is a Magical Girl in the city of Dokonimo, a cross-genre anime roleplaying game in the Metaverse of OMNI. She is unaware that she is playing a game, having done a process many other players have of blanking prior knowledge of the outside world, and deliberately implanting false memories to believe that she exists, and has always existed as, a citizen of Dokonimo. (Except, this is later revealed to not really be the case at all).</p>

<p>Dokonimo isn’t even made by Japanese people, probably.</p>

<p>Her arch-nemesis is Crystal Swan, a charismatic YouTuber/Cult Leader who is seemingly amassing an army. Mirai has fought Crystal in a number of encounters over the past three years.</p>

<p>This is the latest encounter, what Mirai intends to be the final one: on the roof of a skyscraper which Crystal has turned into a super-weapon designed to mass-brainwash the populace of the city. She has been forced to go into this battle alone, as the various guilds are busy.</p>

<p>The battle, however, is cut short by the nearby impact of a meteor causing a shockwave that collapses the building.</p>

<p>Crystal escapes, and Mirai notices that at the point of impact, there appears to be a glyph on the ground.</p>

<p>The following day, the city has rebuilt. Mirai at school enquires about the nature of the impact, and the glyph. People who were also nearby noted that two figures quickly ran off into the city, but people appear sheepish at telling Mirai about the glyph’s meaning.</p>

<p>Mirai visits Megumi, an old-ish woman who has helped Mirai at various points in her career as a magical girl, being that she is a retired one.</p>

<p>Megumi noticed the impact, and agrees to accompany Mirai to roughly where the impact was.</p>

<p>On their way, they encounter two people who seem to be celebrities, being attacked by Crystal Cultists. Rescuing the two famous figures, Megumi appears to recognise them, and the search for the impact site is called off.</p>

<p>At her home, Megumi explains that what Mirai believes is Reality is in fact one world out of many. She deliberately keeps the explanation simple to avoid alarming Mirai, yet Mirai already suspects the true nature of things.</p>

<p>Megumi and the celeb/s take Mirai to a mysterious ‘store’ with a green sign. This store is a telehub, and using the Telehub, they take Mirai to the outer Metaverse, the ‘overworld’ which functions as a between-space seldom used by wealthy members of OMNI.</p>

<p>Mirai states that she understands, now, that the world is Virtual, and that she must by extension, be living within the future, and that the two celebrities are not actually them, as they would be elderly or long dead by ‘the future’ beyond what Mirai believed the year to be: 2015.</p>

<p>Megumi is pleasantly surprised that Mirai cottoned onto the nature of reality so fast, but knows that the arrival of the celebs indicates that a great danger is approaching Dokonimo.</p>

<p>Megumi explains to Mirai that she was placed there by a friend to observe her in Dokonimo. Although later, we learn that Mirai is a bot, an ‘anti-amalgamate’ similar in operation to the true Amalgamate but fighting it, at this stage Mirai is considered differently in the story. Megumi states that Mirai was a brilliant software engineer who inadvertently created the Amalgamate, and observing the calamities wrought by it, hid away in Dokonimo and decided to live another life.</p>

<p>At the time, however, Mirai was prepared to return, when the time was right, to try and desperately stop the Amalgamate. So people like Megumi were lead to believe.</p>

<p>Mirai is told of the dire state of affairs, and then how she fits into all this: She must escort the Duo to a base of operations used by the Counter-Amalgamate. Taking a simple, straightforward route would be easy to track, and is why the Duo have been elusive for so long.</p>

<p>Some time back, another member of the CA hacked into the heart of the Amalgamate and retrieved knowledge-fragments of the Amalgamate’s endgame: To subsume the three Biomatter-fused-AIs and using the overwhelming digital/biological prowess of those minds, mass-amalgamate large swaths of cyberspace.</p>

<p>Yet also, the hacker recovered the location of a kill-switch, whilst a few other members supplied parts of the source code (of the Original, however).</p>

<p>One of the Duo was encoded with this dossier, that is to say, the plan entered their source code and thought-flow processes in a way that is again, designed to avoid detection.</p>

<p>At the base, the dossier will be extracted, and a final decisive attack on the Amalgamate can begin. So it is hoped, anyway.</p>

<p>Crystal Swan amps up her attacks on the city, brainwashing hundreds by striking a deal with other villains. Mirai cannot idly sit by and let this happen, so she goes to fight Crystal once more.</p>

<p>At this point, however, Mirai realises that the cultists of Crystal are not joining her, but being Amalgamated. Using the collective dreambend power of the hundreds of users absorbed, Crystal captures the head Supervillains she collaborated with, and Mirai.&nbsp; She states that it is time for her to fulfill her reason for even being there, which is to both Amalgamate the entirety of Dokonimo and specifically permakill Mirai.</p>

<p>She absorbs the supervillains into herself, and gains a large range of OMNI approved powers. Mirai and Crystal fight, before Crystal transforms the innumerable amalgamated people into a giant Kaiju to attack the city, before taking out another block or two of the city with her powers and running again.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Mirai is quite sick and tired of Crystal’s continual running, but at least she dealt some damage.</p>

<p>People are being absorbed into the Amalgamate by the Kaiju (mayb its kinda swan lookin idk) and when I said ‘another block or two’ I meant that the people there were amalgamated, not that those blocks were physically destroyed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mirai feels that she must stay and defend, but aware that there is a bigger universe, and that Crystal seems to have departed into that Metaverse, she resolves to leave Dokonimo.</p>

<p>Her Mascot character decides to stay and fight with the other Heroes and Mechanica organisations in Dokonimo. The Mascot has a super-form somewhat like Keroberos in Cardcaptor Sakura, but like…. Kaiju-sized.</p>

<p>Mirai goes to leave to the Telehub, but Megumi stops her and takes her to a car park. There, she finds Megumi has an extravagant vessel called a CARDIS, a Car TARDIS. TARDIS type vehicles in OMNI, despite being in violation of various rules regarding vehicle move speeds (to thus ensure that Telehubs are still required and useful), are allowed by the administration, and basically travel so fast it is akin to teleportation. Because they are so game-breaking, they cost an absurd amount of Units to buy. The CARDIS is a more practical model, being that it can disguise itself as literally any vehicle that fits an area and can function as that vehicle also. (The pricing range starts with a standard ‘Doctor Who’ TARDIS at the base range, a functioning ‘Chameleon’ TARDIS above that, then CARDIS, then a personal Pocket-Tardis above even that).</p>

<p>Using the CARDIS, they go into the greater Metaverse to search for Crystal’s whereabouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mirai wants to explore OMNI, to get a feel for what it is actually like in the Future, so Megumi obliges, hoping their brief travels will shed some light on Crystal. It is at this point that players can do a few sidequests.</p>

<p>Their journey takes them to the Archive, where they meet Cyrus.</p>

<p>Cyrus is a researcher at the Archive, which is literally just the Internet Archive of the present.</p>

<p>Being filled in on the details, Cyrus suggests that Crystal is likely attempting to quite simply shake off the party, given that her power resides in her amalgamated individuals, and that she will eventually return to Dokonimo. Cyrus joins them.</p>

<p>Looking around the Overworld near Dokonimo, they find her hiding, with a miniboss.</p>

<p>She attempts to abscond again, but this time the party pursues her across cyberspace.</p>

<p>She warps between sites, then later just flies in the Overworld. This chase in the Overworld is cut short when she shoots at the CARDIS and somehow, inexplicably causes damage. The ship begins to crash, with the party mostly safe in the Console Room.</p>

<p>The crash damages the Console Room, and knocks out the party. Awakening, they find that the room is partly spliced into the outside, and that they are on an unusual world.</p>

<p>Megumi despawns the CARDIS to let the item cool-down and rebuild in her inventory.</p>

<p>Exploring the world, they learn that they have crashed onto a world in the Space Operatic RPG Cosmos.</p>

<p>They are arrested for basically breaking the RP, and thrown into jail. There they meet Hanah, a Spacer, which is to say, a person who doesn’t really align with any of the four nations of Cosmos and instead just sort of does their own thing.</p>

<p>Even Spacers who have good intentions are, in some nations, hunted down. In the Empire, for instance, which is revealed to be where the Party is now.</p>

<p>Hanah is a semi-immersed player, in that they are partly aware that there is a larger Metaverse but generally believing that their world they play is Reality.</p>

<p>She is surprised by the presence of outsiders, as usually tourists keep to the more extravagant sights of the game.</p>

<p>They explain to her that they were shot down by Crystal Swan, and that she and her higher-up basically represent and existential threat to the universe.</p>

<p>Hanah is nonplussed by this, believing such a risk to be impossible, but agrees to help them get out, as she was planning to do that anyway.</p>

<p>Through some means, they escape, and then stealth-mission their way out the prison. Hanah reclaims her ship, and they flee the planet.</p>

<p>They ask Hanah if she can come along with them, to fight the Amalgamate, but she refuses. They ask her if she can take them out of Cosmos, and she refuses again. She has business to attend to.</p>

<p>Hanah is a bounty hunter, she was tracking a notorious space pirate ringleader into Imperial space, when she was caught by authorities. She thinks that the pirate leader is hanging out in the asteroid belt of whatever like come on this shit isn’t massively important to the grand scale overview of the story!</p>

<p>Anyway, the gang help Hanah with their various talents, and they face down the space pirate leader. Again, the reach of the Amalgamate is hinted at, it is implied the people the pirate caught and sold into slavery were actually being sold to the Amalgamate.</p>

<p>Impressed by their help, Hanah decides that she should return the favour and actually help them after all.</p>

<p>So, they leave Cosmos and go to once more look for Crystal.</p>

<p>They find that whilst they were busy doing a mini-main quest and sidequests within Cosmos, Crystal has succeeded in constructing a dreambent structure near one of the Biomat-AIs representations, and is initiating an attempt to brute-force hijack its servers.</p>

<p>They enter the dungeon, and find it heavily guarded by Amalgamated. They rescue one of the Duo, who was taken in the confusion, and is the more important one. Megumi is killed, facing Crystal first.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mirai, Cyrus, Hanah and the more useful member of the Duo face Crystal. They make sure she cannot run, but she has no intention to, being this close to victory.</p>

<p>The final boss of chapter one ensues.</p>

<p>After defeating her, the largely illusory structure begins to collapse, with the help of the Biomats who dreambend also and help ‘undo’ the existence of the structure.</p>

<p>Mirai gets a message seemingly from Megumi, congratulating her. Attached is the CARDIS, fully remade.</p>

<p>Deploying it, she returns the other characters to their respective locations, before returning to Dokonimo.</p>

<p>In Dokonimo, she is reunited with her Mascot, and tells them her adventure.</p>

<p>A delegation of the Counter-Amalgamate is there to greet her, also, and they award her with… something. IDK yet.</p>

<p>Mirai prepares to return to her everyday life, believing that now Crystal is defeated, the Amalgamate would’ve experienced a major set back to allow the CA to finish the fight.</p>

<p>However, Megumi leaves her a message on her phone, telling her to try logging off.</p>

<p>Mirai tries, but she cannot.</p>

<p>She is being stalked by someone.</p>

<h2>Disc 2</h2>

<p>It is several months into the future, and Mirai is in the Outer-Reality.</p>

<p>IRL, she is heading into a mostly derelict British suburbia to meet Megumi.</p>

<p>Megumi is a fairly innocuous presence, living in a humble house with archaic goggle based VR interfaces.</p>

<p>She is also called Megan.</p>

<p>Mirai, who is accessing Reality via AR-drones, is confused by this development. How did Megumi, when they were traveling, teach Mirai the secrets of Dreambending. Dreambending is basically a higher form of magic, beyond that of the officially approved magic system of OMNI. It can cause lasting, ‘true’ damage to users rather than just HP damage.</p>

<p>However, to do it, you need to be using Digital Dream Interfaces, which Megan wasn’t.</p>

<p>Megan explains to Mirai that she was simply teaching what she used to do when she used DDIs, and that Mirai had an innate and inherent knack to Dreambending, likely because of her past life.</p>

<p>Mirai talks about the stalker. Megan recognises the description, and tells her of the Emissary, the Amalgamate’s right-hand man. He is basically an agent sent to mark individuals for hijacking, or entire populations.</p>

<p>Megan tells her it is time she met the CA in person, and gives her an IP address to enter at a Telehub.</p>

<p>Back in the Metaverse, Mirai enters the address and connects to a private server outside of the OMNI network. There, she meets the leaders of the Counter-Amalgamate who tell her that they have hatched a plan to destroy the connective tissue of the Amalgamate, thus leaving it open to a forced shut-down or initiation of its internal killswitch. (Oops, this is because, at the end of Chapter 1, the Duo was dropped off with a connection to this secret realm. I prolly should’ve explained that above).</p>

<p>To tear the links in the Amalgamate apart, they will retrieve the keys of the DNS security layer. These keys are scattered across the world, possessed by individuals once security experts and the like, but with time, increasingly mundane people.</p>

<p>Through assembling these keys, accessing the backup keycards in Reality and reseting the master-key of the DNS, the DNS would be rendered inoperable for many months.</p>

<p>During this time, the Amalgamate would be isolated, and could be destroyed.</p>

<p>(Note: I know this is only partly based on real things, and for the purposes of the game, there will only be 7 keys as in various clickbaity articles (a Guardian article however puts it at 14?) bemoaned by ICAAN. It will be explained that with time, the nature of the keys, and possession of them, will have changed to be even more ludicrously plot-devicey for the sake of narrative).</p>

<p>Here, Mirai meets Cyrus again, who is revealed to be a keyholder. Cyrus states that they should travel to recruit Alessa, who is completely immersed in a fantasy RP simulacra, and is another keyholder. (Hiding in plain sight seems to be the ideology of ICAAN or whoever runs the net in the 2070s).</p>

<p>Please, I’m not bothering going into the Lore about this Fantasy world here just like I’m not bothering with Cosmos lore! This is a broad strokes synopses of the entire thing, okay?</p>

<p>Alessa is a knight, anyway, in this world. Knights in this world basically have giant robots also. These are not robots, however.</p>

<p>There is a small Alessa Fantasy World Story Taster Quest then uuh, she’s in your party and you are free to go!</p>

<p>Before going to Alessa, you learn that one of the keyholders is in Cosmos anyway. After recruiting Alessa, you travel back to Cosmos. In Chapter 2, Cosmos is substantially fleshed out as an environment. Although you have some sidequests, and some degree of exploration of it, in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 is when Cosmos becomes an entire sublevel of the game. Hanah is the first character in the game to be given an entire 4 chapter side story to pursue. This is not exactly true, at this point all characters get that, however as the game nudges you towards Cosmos, it is likely Hanah’s you encounter first.</p>

<p>You are informed that the keyholder is a stock broker in Cosmos’s virtual stock market. To any player, this is blatantly a riff off Eve Online’s similar BS. You spend some time exploring and trying to find out exactly where this dude lives. You might have to beat up some guys, I don’t exactly know yet.</p>

<p>Anyway, after finding this incredibly dull man, you find that he is kinda undergoing a… heist of some sort. A hacker called Holly has broken into his /literal/ physical location to steal the keycard for herself. Holly is also syphoning his funds, but keeps hopping between her avatar, and his, and is clearly motivated by the card.</p>

<p>The party seem ready to fight, however, she absconds before any altercation could take place.</p>

<p>The gang return to the Counter-Amalgamate, and explain the situation. Alessa is filled in also, and is finding this all very strange being that she was convinced her Fantasy RPG World was Consensus Reality.</p>

<p>They decide the only valid move is to draw Holly out, and tell the party to subtly make it clear to someone watching that the next keyholder, Therion is… well, it!</p>

<p>They travel to a Steampunk themed world. They note how odd it is that all the cardholders universally seem to exist within immersive RPGs. However, it becomes apparent that Therion is only partly immersed, and is aware of the notion of there being a tangible, virtual multiverse.</p>

<p>Through whatever means, I’m not yet sure at this broad-strokes stage, they make it clear that Therion is a keyholder and that they are after him. I don’t think Social Media is really a thing at that point in the future, maybe in some vestigal form? More than likely, it should probably be that Holly knew that they were looking for keyholders as they were blabbing before attempting to fight her earlier, and so knew to just follow them and be 2 steps ahead.</p>

<p>This time, they are ready, and Holly is ready also. There is a boss battle, Holly doesn’t seem close to losing, and gets bored. She leaves, deciding to just let them do their plan and then just gather all the keycards when they’re done.</p>

<p>Of course, the party say to her, before she leaves again, that they won’t continue searching unless she gives up her keycard from Cosmos. She refuses, stating that it needs to be obtained in person, really, and that they are all technically still separate at the moment.</p>

<p>They decide to then simply press on, and be ready for her when she tries /whatever/ in the future. Holly didn’t exactly gloat her entire plan, simply implied that she’d try something else later on.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Holly goes to meet the Emissary of the Amalgamate. She doesn’t narc on the party, but she does imply that something is up with keyholders, and that she has a keycard from one of them and is willing to work for the Amalgamate if she is lead to the next card (aiming to get there before the party again).</p>

<p>The Amalgamate, not being dumb, decides to not trust her, but simply act upon her information.</p>

<p>Holly, feeling burnt but choosing not to retalitate, decides to bide her time. Her end goal in the acquisition of the cards has always been the outright destruction of the net. She explains this, during her second encounter. She wants the cards, believing that she can weild their ultimately minor influence on the workings of the net to bring it down. She is motivated by a long-lived spite towards the destruction of the Old Web, during her teenage years, and the emergence of Social Media which proceeded to consign humanity ultimately to the future where they live in VR and hide from the collapsing Reality.</p>

<p>She had heard of, but been nonplussed by, of the Amalgamate. Although it also wanted to see the net gone, its goals were simply Bad in Holly’s eyes. Holly, being as she was, a child of the 90s and very old by the time of DigiDream, was a Singularity Sceptic. However, she had hoped that she could maybe use it for her own gain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her rejection by the Amalgamate sets her on a path to later join the heroes, but not yet.</p>

<p>The party travels to a Solarpunk world, to recruit Alfyn. There is a little bit of exploration and flavour given to this world. However this is the last point in the entire of Chapter 2 where it is possible to complete sidequests and side stories.</p>

<p>It soon becomes apparent, even as Alfyn agrees to come along, that the Amalgamate is there. The capital of the Solarpunk world is attacked, Amalgamated spreading out to assault other settlements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Traveling to the capital, they find it completely wiped of detail and structure, and a mass attempting to infiltrate a subterranean structure.</p>

<p>In this core, they find the Emissary, who introduces himself. He implies that Holly lead him here, but never names names. Regardless, there is a battle. This battle is seemingly going well, only for him to turn the tables in the second half. He picks off the party members, killing their avatars in some cases or prompting others to teleport out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mirai is the only one who survives, being kept alive by the Emissary. He takes the generative AI that is the heart of the Solarpunk world. This AI was the only thing that kept the world extant, the entire simulation being dreamt by this one bot.</p>

<p>The Solarpunk world vanishes, and using the powerful new system which has been absorbed, the Amalgamate manages to work its way into the inner workings of OMNI and push a ‘critical security patch’, forcibly installing it to all users there and then.</p>

<p>It is unclear what this patch has done, at first. The Emissary dreambends Mirai to the ‘surface’ and follows. Many users are teleporting out, spawning vehicles, trying to escape being amalgamated. However, he swiftly performs an attack that destroys them.</p>

<p>Bringing a dead avatar to them, he quickly breaks into their account and machine, opening a viewport of their room and showing that the actual user is also dead.</p>

<p>He teleports out, leaving Mirai in the void. She thinks about the image. That could’ve been fake, right? How did he hack into the cameras in that person’s room? This seems a little implausible…</p>

<p>But, why doubt it. Even she got the patch. She wonders if her friends are alright.</p>

<p>She uses what few Units she has to warp to a major city/plaza. A panic has gripped the space. Using a Telepresence Booth, she warps to Reality.</p>

<p>She goes to see Megan. Megan is aware of what has happened, and confirms that yes, the Emissary was not just lying, trying to scare Mirai. People can die in OMNI now, like the oft-cliched phrase of ‘you die in the game, you die in real life’.</p>

<p>Worse, users can no longer be pulled from Dream Interfaces, meaning the one viable route of saving someone from amalgamation has vanished.</p>

<p>Megan is starting to get worried. She fears that if the Amalgamate is not stopped, it will learn to control the bodies with greater efficiency and usher in a ‘zombie apocalypse’ scenario.</p>

<p>Mirai resolves to not let that happen. Despite everything, she believes that she will be reunited with the others, and that she can find the remaining two keyholders and defeat the Amalgamate.</p>

<h2>Disc 3</h2>

<p>It is several months into the future.</p>

<p>The Metaverse is not what it used to be.</p>

<p>Numerous sites have isolated themselves from the Mastodon style ‘federation’ model OMNI uses, to save themselves from the Amalgamate.</p>

<p>Sites are being amalgamated or destroyed on a regular, sorta once-a-week pace. Users are scared. Many are trying to return to Reality only to find that somehow worse, or that they simply cannot adjust. Others live on in their complete immersion RPs, utterly oblivious to the calamity unfolding outside their world.</p>

<p>The addition of Actual Death to the Metaverse was done to aid the Amalgamate, to allow it to more conventionally terrorise people into giving it what it wanted, and to make it harder to disconnect.</p>

<p>Yet, the obvious and unfortunate side-effect of this has been a new dimension of Cybercrime. Unfortunately, OMNI is filled with Very Lethal Magical Items, and it’s actually very easy to get these! So people are just plain being killed, petty wars are starting up here and there.</p>

<p>Oh well.</p>

<p>Mirai has been wandering the Metaverse.</p>

<p>She has been searching for Cyrus, mainly. She believes that he will know where the others are, and also feels it is only right, as he was her first ‘recruit’ at the start of all this.</p>

<p>Now, finally, she infiltrates the hideout of Amalgamate sympathising group. The Amalgamate has let these groups perform their tasks unabsorbed, believing that they can serve a more nuanced function than what it can muster. Ultimately, many aren’t even criminal, simply working to indoctrinate and rehabilitate the image of the Amalgamate in the eyes of the fearful public.</p>

<p>Cyrus has been kidnapped by these, as a sort of general writer for pro-Amalgamate screeds, a propagandist basically. If he didn’t, he would be amalgamated, and his knowledge of the others would be in the hands of the enemy. Unfortunately, it may find its way to the Amalgamate through some other means, he is living life on a ticking clock. If he just sold out his friends, he would be free to go right away, but he knows that as long as he writes propaganda for them, the amalgamation ‘bomb’ he has been installed with will never truly go off.</p>

<p>Still, this sucks! And is having a terrible effect on his psyche.</p>

<p>Mirai shows up and breaks him out. Mirai is kinda Not Fucking Around at this point, the pro-Amalgamate group is basically killed, with a few survivors. There is little time for thinking or reasoning when your friend’s life is on the line!</p>

<p>They steal one of the group’s ships, and Mirai resets it, in case it is being tracked.</p>

<p>She asks Cyrus if he knew where everyone else went. Cyrus doesn’t exactly, but he explains what happened after the encounter with the Emissary. He was one of the Keyholders who managed to teleport away before dying. He warped into one of many general plazas, and with his HP restored, went to see where the others were.</p>

<p>Foolishly, despite OMNI having a Friends List and other social features, the group never made much use of them, as they were all rolled up into a team through the adventure.</p>

<p>However, he finds that some residual contacts exist on a ‘recent users’ list. Unfortunately, it is only Alessa, as warping to the Plaza filled the list with more users. However, it revealed that Alessa respawned in her homeworld.</p>

<p>Cyrus set off to reach Alessa, buying a ship. As he travelled, he found that the Metaverse was ‘going dark’, sites were voluntarily shutting themselves out of the network to save themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He could’ve teleported, rather than spending a considerable amount of time slowly traversing the Metaverse in a vehicle. However, Cyrus did not know of the CARdis whereabouts, and knew a vessel would be needed for the party to reassemble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After a few days of travelling, Cyrus found Alessa’s homeworld. Landing at the Onport and adhering himself to the RP rules to enter this time, he begins to look for her.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after finding her, he finds that she had slowly been losing her memory of the adventure. Her existence within the Simulacra has caused the opt-in immersion effects to take hold, slowly wiping her memory of the un-immersive knowledge of a larger Metaverse.</p>

<p>There, he finds a troubling cult growing in popularity, which he recognises as being pro-Amalgamate in a ‘lore compliant’ way.</p>

<p>He urges Alessa to, at the very least, aid him in breaking up this cult.</p>

<p>Their journey to destroy this cult lead to Alessa to regain her memories, however Cyrus was captured by the cult and warped off world, the cult knowing who he was, and recognising his importance.</p>

<p>He knows at least that Alessa got away, and knew where his ship was and how to start it.</p>

<p>Mirai wonders how to find this ship, if there could be a lookup system or something. However, it isn’t that simple.</p>

<p>Despite that, the idea of looking for a ship piques her curiosity, and she hatches a plan to find the CARDIS. She will attempt to draw whoever got hold of that vehicle to her.</p>

<p>Yet, when considering the events, Mirai realises that she has had the CARDIS key’s on her all along, having been given them by Megan at the Amalgamate’s superstructure when it attempted to take one of the Biomat AIs (Chapter 1 ending).</p>

<p>She summons the vehicle, and decides to search for the remaining two keyholders first, rather than regroup everyone now.</p>

<p>First up, a ‘influencer’ named Primrose. Primrose’s story section is the most heavily tied to the nature of OMNI as simply ‘the thing everyone uses in the future’, not based in any particular themed world.</p>

<p>After Primrose, they finally recruit Olberic, who exists within a fairly genre-standard Cyberpunk sim. Olberic, not a fully immersed user, has some knowledge of what was happening ‘outside’ his world, and was considering logging off before you showed up.</p>

<p>With a small party of 4, Mirai is slightly more capable of facing slightly bigger challenges.</p>

<p>Regardless, they decide to head to Cosmos to look for Hanah, thinking that she may have respawned there or simply returned after the attack.</p>

<p>On Cosmos, they find instead Holly. Feelings towards Holly are pretty icy, as the party all recall what the Emissary said, and feel that all this is her fault.</p>

<p>A small battle is followed by Holly leaving, but not without giving them a hint for Hanah’s wearabouts.</p>

<p>She stated that Hanah is one of the users who logged off, and so the party Telepres into Reality to follow the lead Holly gave them.</p>

<p>They find that Hanah is living in a colossal ‘Google Plex’, a quasi-Arcology housing millions, providing them a basic sustenance. Most citizens in the Plex live in OMNI, the place being ideally suited for sleepwalk-surviving.</p>

<p>However, it isn’t really that easy.</p>

<p>Hanah is living a remarkably old-fashioned life in the sterile halls of Google. She accesses the flat-web on her Google provided phone, lives a simple, rote life and doesn’t touch her Digital Dream Interface.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Digital Dream Interface has, at this point in the century, some AR capabilities to make telepresence work. And so, to Hanah, they are completely invisible and inaudible.</p>

<p>However, they are not invisible to Google. Speaking through Google, Hanah reconnects to her Interface and sees them.</p>

<p>They explain what has happened, who the two newbies are, and what is left to do.</p>

<p>Hanah agrees that it’s time for her to return to OMNI. They ask what she would’ve done had they never shown up, and she states that the fairly routine life, and bottomless content of the old web, was enough to keep her entertained until she just died of old age.</p>

<p>However, she did note that it was certainly boring, living that way.</p>

<p>Luckily, Hanah tells them that she has been in touch with another. Alessa has been sending her physical mail via some service or other look its not really important other than she just has been.</p>

<p>Alessa, in her most recent letter, stated that she was heading towards the Boundary of OMNI, to investigate beyond the ‘Overlaid Metaverse’.</p>

<p>The majority of the inner Solar System is overlaid with the Virtual World. That is to say, the websites, games and other places seen thus far in the story have existed within the actual inner Solar System as an AR layer on top of Reality. The edge of this, just beyond the Asteroid Belt, is the ‘Boundary’ of OMNI. The Boundary slowly gets larger every so often, but the users of OMNI have found ample space in the inner Solar System to build their sites and services.</p>

<p>OMNI works on ‘Traditional Cyberspace Rules’, the sites are literally, or should literally, be representations of the data stored within, and the more data the bigger the site. One trick developers used to work around this is conceal the ‘Data Structures’ beyond the Boundary, in the outer Solar System, keeping them beyond the sight of users.</p>

<p>Alessa thus has gone to that realm, and the realm beyond that, to search for the Amalgamate’s Core Data Structure.</p>

<p>Deciding that this is the only good lead they have, they head out to the Boundary, having to manually fly the CARDIS.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they are attacked by a group of ludicrous players who style themselves as Cyberspace Pirates.</p>

<p>The party thinks these guys are kinda dumb, but then are shocked when one of the pirates in the boarding party is Therion.</p>

<p>Therion remarks at the ludicrous odds of it being them, and states that he joined the pirates thinking that they were only playing, only to find uuh no they were totally serious. Like I said, Cybercrime sure is different in uuh, the post Amalgamate world.</p>

<p>Therion calls off the pirate attack, and states that he has a powerful bomb item which will destroy them both if they don’t leave. This is total bullshit, but the pirates buy it, and fly away.</p>

<p>The party wonder what lead to Therion finding them, however contrived it may be. Therion recounts how, on the days leading up to this, there were subtle clues and more overt events guiding them to that area of Cyberspace. Yet they waited, for several more days, with nothing showing up.</p>

<p>Very few people actually travel around Cyberspace like real Space, preferring to just teleport around. Vehicles are typically more a thing for getting around in Sites, because you can only teleport from telehub to telehub.</p>

<p>Anyway, the Therion supernatural guidance shit is just a bit of foreshadowing.</p>

<p>Therion, when thinking of the strange circumstances that pushed the pirates to Mirai’s ship, recalls a similar incident a few months back, when shortly after joining, a series of mysterious incidents lead them instead to find Alfyn, who was living a fairly dull life in OMNI.</p>

<p>It is quite apparent that some greater power is bringing them back together, Mirai speculates if Megan is somehow setting up these things in secret.</p>

<p>The party go and track down the pirates, and this leads them to the ever-moving pirate base. They battle their way into the heart of the base, rescue Alfyn, and escape back towards the Boundary.</p>

<p>The Boundary is a giant, white sphere that encloses the inner Solar System. It is kinda invisible, or hard to make out, from within the system, due to the various atmospheric effects OMNI maintains to make Cyberspace feel like a more magical outer space (or something).</p>

<p>Passing through, they enter a vast, more conventionally void-like space filled with the giant Data Structures of everything within OMNI.</p>

<p>They wonder how the heck they will possibly find Alessa here.</p>

<p>Mirai seems confident that the ‘Higher Power’ will bring them together, but before that has to get involved, Hanah notes that she just heard a notification chime in Reality and logs off.</p>

<p>They telepres back to Hahah’s room in the Google Plex and see that has some freshly delivered mail.</p>

<p>It is another letter from Alessa, obviously, as nothing else really uses Physical Mail in the late 21st Century.</p>

<p>Alessa’s letter tells them that she has travelled even further out, into the Dreamplane, which is not really supposed to be visited.</p>

<p>Hanah writes a reply, stating that she has teamed up with Mirai, and the party is pretty much reassembled. She mentions that they are beyond the Boundary, and will head into the Dreamplane.</p>

<p>Alessa will get this letter immediately, as the address is literally her inventory. Hanah gives it to Google, who scans it, and sends it off.</p>

<p>They all switch back to OMNI.</p>

<p>The Dreamplane is a band of digital strata that surrounds the outer Solar System. When using Digital Dream Interfaces, real dreams are not so much ‘a thing that doesn’t happen anymore’ as they are ‘a thing you just don’t see anymore’. People still dream, as dreams are important for memories and other mental processes, however, to keep them from interfering OMNI, the software offloads them into a place beyond the Metaverse.</p>

<p>Given everyone’s Interfaces are networked, these dreams all blend into one collective Dream World, called the Dreamplane.</p>

<p>It should be impossible to find anything there. It should be impossible to navigate ‘through’ it to the outskirts of the Solar System and the Cyberspace overlay.</p>

<p>However, if someone is expecting you, it shouldn’t be too hard. Alessa is there waiting for them when they arrive. She tells them that their ship will be useless going forward, and that the only path they have to get through is to continually head east.</p>

<p>East is an abstract concept in a world made of fragments of everyone’s minds.</p>

<p>Space is constantly shifting. Alessa maintains an overlay of Actual Space on some level of her Sensorium to see where to go. So, they head towards the edge of the Dreamplane, whatever that looks like.</p>

<p>There are actual threats out here, which are compliant with the OMNI game systems. This is because everyone lives so much in OMNI, there dreams are of it, and so mechanics and other aspects of the software are crudely echoed in actual dreams.</p>

<p>Finally, they reach what should be the edge, but find themselves unable to pass through without collectively ‘willing’ the dream out of their perception.</p>

<p>They are in the outskirts of Space, barely even Cyberspace now.</p>

<p>The Data Structures are tiny, colourful objects surrounding the white sphere of OMNI, through which the sunlight still shines.</p>

<p>They aren’t being told by the software they should be dying, or that even they should be floating. They are standing in the void.</p>

<p>And there, just out there, is a small white box.</p>

<p>That’s gotta be it!</p>

<p>They walk to the cube, and find on it a single door.</p>

<p>Inside, they find a girl. She reminds Mirai of herself, but she is not so much an Anime Girl as she is a JRPG-Type Girl.</p>

<p>The girl is interacting with several floating screens, but appears to be in a strange sort of fugue. That is, until they cross the threshold into the room.</p>

<p>The girl gets up, and wonders who they are. They ask instead if she is the Amalgamate. She says that yeah, she is, but that she prefers the name ‘Yui’.</p>

<p>Yui asks why they are there, and they plainly state that it is to stop her.</p>

<p>So, Yui sits back down, and says that there is nothing to stop. She is only trying to elevate Humanity, to save them from themselves. If she doesn’t do it, someone else like her will. It’s the Singularity!</p>

<p>Mirai asks her why she won’t fight, and she says that it really isn’t in her interest to.</p>

<p>Sensing this as a good chance to prepare a pre-emptive strike, Mirai quietly urges the party to switch to old-style goggle interfaces. She asks Hanah to ask Google for one in Reality.</p>

<p>When she returns, Hanah says that it worked, and asks the other players who are in Google Plexes to do so.</p>

<p>Yui states that she can hear all this, and begrudgingly starts to fight, first attempting to amalgamate the non-goggled users.</p>

<p>Mirai stops her, and feels a strange connection. Yui attempts to absorb Mirai, but finds that not only can’t she do it, Mirai isn’t exactly human or bot.</p>

<p>Yui realises that Mirai is like her, an Amalgamate, somehow. Mirai doesn’t quite see how this is possible. Yui attempts to enter her mind, to access her Kill Switch, assuming that she has one. Fearing that she is right, and knowing that if she is right and she just dies normally she won’t die, Mirai kills herself whilst Yui is attempting to hack into her, doing a whole Gandalf ‘run you fools’ type thing to the rest of the party.</p>

<p>The party abscond into the Dreamplane, wishing for the CARDIS and making it kinda just appear there.</p>

<p>Mirai drifts into her own dream.</p>

<p>In her dream, she learns that yes, she really is an Amalgamate. She is the Counter-Amalgamate, the consensual force of users and bots who pooled their resources together to attempt to stop the Amalgamate.</p>

<p>This is actually a second twist. One of the things I’ve forgotten to mention until this point is that when the Emissary was ‘fighting’ them at the end of Chapter 2, he mentions to Mirai that she is possibly both the creator of the Amalgamate and implies that this creator is his mom. This aligns with other bits of information you would’ve received earlier in the story that leads you to believe that Mirai was someone else at some point, and ran into Dokomino to hide from the guilt of causing all this mess. Yet this is basically not true!&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I forgot to mention it here, and I feel it’s actually kinda dumb having two such twists, this might never be explicitly stated, rather a thing characters imply thinking Mirai is.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, they are all wrong. We learn that the actual creator of the Amalgamate went to Dokomino as part of the C-A, and using its resources, Dreambent a user into existence. This user is partly a bot, yes, but her mind is actually of the collective.</p>

<p>This is how Mirai is so proficient at Dreambending.</p>

<p>Mirai realises that she doesn’t possess a kill-switch like Yui thought she would, as she is not as like her as she thought. Mirai is a bot, but Yui was something of an individual avatar for her collective. Her collective has a kill switch, and her collective is only as strong as the network is.</p>

<p>This is how, she realises, she can make the DNS reset plan actually work. The DNS plan always had a mystery ending, how did they then intend to kill the Amalgamate? However, this answers that question.</p>

<p>They will trigger the reset in Reality whilst Mirai is trying to enter the Amalgamate’s inner-space in OMNI.</p>

<p>Once she is in, she will give a signal, telling them to ‘flip the switch’ and sever the DNS links that power the Amalgamate.</p>

<p>She realises that this will also severely damage herself, but that she has no other option.</p>

<p>Finally, whilst dreaming, she realises that the mysterious events guiding everyone back together have been members and aspects of the C-A pushing things on a massive scale.</p>

<p>This is the ‘Road to Endgame’.</p>

<p>Mirai wakes up into a new avatar. She is 3D now, older, but still kinda recognisably ‘her’.</p>

<p>She finds the CARDIS key in her inventory, and summons it to her. Inside, she finds the party, waiting, knowing that she would return.</p>

<p>The party tell her their side of the story, which Mirai had a small glimpse of before entering flashback territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mirai saw them get into the CARDIS and fly out towards OMNI.</p>

<p>However, as they approached OMNI, they find that the Emissary is waiting for them.</p>

<p>They battle him, his power blunted by them all using goggle-systems.</p>

<p>Before they can just straight up kill him though, he flees, somehow possessing an instant warp to the Amalgamate, it seems.</p>

<p>They return to OMNI, and just kinda hang around in space waiting for Mirai to come back.</p>

<p>Hanah stated that as the CARDIS was Mirai’s vehicle, she could summon it to her when she respawned.</p>

<p>They know that she can respawn because they heard what Yui said. They know that she won’t be dead, like a normal user, and that she will reincarnate somehow if not using the actual respawn system.</p>

<p>Mirai talks to the party and they resolve to visit Megan.</p>

<p>In Reality, Megan states that she honestly had no idea that Mirai was the C-A.</p>

<p>Megan thought Mirai was, as implied in other bits of dialogue, the creator of the Amalgamate. When pressed on if she knows who this creator is, Megan states that although she does, she never bothered to keep in touch as she thought she was Mirai in Dokomino.</p>

<p>Contacting her, they ask if it is okay to visit.</p>

<p>She lives near Megan, it turns out.</p>

<p>Well, ‘near’ is a bit loose but uuh they are both in the UK.</p>

<p>The creator, Sophia, is elderly and mostly happy living with old tech now. She is dismayed to learn what is happening in OMNI, thinking that she disabled the Amalgamate decades ago when she was working on it with others. She hints that this Amalgamate may not be the first, but that yes, it should have a kill switch.</p>

<p>She tells Mirai how to access Yui’s mental realm and reach the kill switch.</p>

<p>And so, saying bye, they return to OMNI.</p>

<p>There are a few sidequests here, but not all worlds are open, and major sidequests are kept for the post-game.</p>

<p>They realise that they need to recruit Holly to get all the keys, just before they set off to the Amalgamate again.</p>

<p>So, they set a ‘really obvious trap’. Holly, surprisingly, falls for this ‘very public callout’ type of trap, but they don’t fight.</p>

<p>They try and persuade to Holly, how they have to stop the Amalgamate. Holly wants to destroy the internet, but not humanity, and the Amalgamate possesses an existential threat to everyone.</p>

<p>She doesn’t need persuading though. She has started to think as such since their last encounter, and agrees to accompany them.</p>

<p>They head out beyond the Boundary, and then to the Dreamplane.</p>

<p>They find every ‘step’ of the way that the Amalgamate has started to tighten security, growing paranoid.</p>

<p>Megan communicates with the party via the CARDIS. She gives them all a substantive sum of money, and tells them to get to Los Angeles ASAP with their keycards.</p>

<p>The party log off, except Mirai, who proceeds into the Dreamplane alone.</p>

<p>IRL, the party all meet in LA. It’s quiet, these days, the skyline punctuated by Silicon Valley Corp’s Arcologies.</p>

<p>They head to the ICANN HQ.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mirai continues her journey.</p>

<p>At ICANN, the party find that despite being keycard holders, and that the rules did change in 2045 to make it more ‘cool’, they can’t just reset the security infrastructure of the Net on the drop of a hat. The keys are for a machine to generate another key, which is then entered into a machine which will create a new master security key that the DNS uses for security purposes (or something).</p>

<p>Mirai approaches the edge of the Dreamplane.</p>

<p>The party finally persuade a very higher up of the gravity of their situation. Preparing to hit go on the reset, they hear signs that a commotion is happening outside.</p>

<p>In the dreamplane, now on the edge of it, Mirai struggles to escape. On her own, her collective nature is leading to the equally collective dream she occupies to become recursive and amplified.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She tries to bend the dream out of her perception, but alone she starts thinking that she cannot.</p>

<p>The commotion outside is pro-Amalgamate groups and people possessed by the Amalgamate advancing on the HQ. They are breaking into the building. Things are gonna get quite ugly, and although the party is proficient at fighting in Cyberspace, they are less so in Reality.</p>

<p>Mirai shuts the dream off and runs to the Amalgamate’s structure.</p>

<p>There, she finds a weakened Emissary. A small battle, the pre-pre final boss, happens.</p>

<p>He is killed, and asks how his mom is. You have the choice to be ‘kind’ (and say that she remembers you) or cold (that she has outright forgotten you) to the Emissary.</p>

<p>(By the way, yeah uuh, she only dimly remembers her son, Sophia. Like uuh, she stopped talking to him after he got involved with the Amalgamate or the Crystal Swan Cult).</p>

<p>Mirai just barges in and starts attacking the Amalgamate.</p>

<p>Yui snaps out of her trance and fights back. In Reality, the Amalgamate Zombies just kinda stop, but the pro-Amalgamate factions don’t really care and keep going.</p>

<p>Mirai tries to get into Yui’s Cognispace.</p>

<p>This is the first stage of the Final Boss Battle.</p>

<p>Entering Yui’s mind. She finds that the kill switch is heavily guarded. Fighting through enemies, Mirai eventually reaches the heart of Yui’s mind, with the switch.</p>

<p>The second stage, and third stage happen.</p>

<p>During the third stage, Mirai gives the signal. The keys are reset, Cyberspace is pulled apart. Mirai, though severely weakened, holds it together better than Yui. Her Cogniplane is falling apart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mirai flips the switch, and Yui shuts down.</p>

<p>The Amalgamated in reality collapse, but pro-Amalgamate forces find they still live. Incensed with what they see as a sign of the death of the Amalgamate (they can’t be sure they’re too busy being dicks IRL right now) they set the ICANN HQ alight. The party escape and get on the barely-functioning-in-2079 Metro to the Airport undetected.</p>

<p>Mirai is killed again by the collapse of Yui.</p>

<p>She dreams again, but this time of nothing.</p>

<p>She finds her personality, and memories, are slipping away, but holds on to them, despite no longer being connected to the collective. She finds herself again.</p>

<p>Mirai respawns in Dokomino as an anime again, but not a kid/teen.</p>

<p>She meets her Mascot, and sees how everyone is doing. They are surprised by how much she’s changed.</p>

<p>Deciding it is time to leave. She summons the CARDIS. The party are all there. They congratulate her, and she them, on their success.</p>

<p>It is now the Post-Game.</p>

<p>Each character has a story of their own, which you can play along with various other sidequests.</p>

<p>These stories build upon the multi-chapter individual stories of the main game, before the world got separated.</p>

<p>The post-game, accordingly, time skips a few months, after the DNS has been fully shifted post-reset and everything is back online.</p>

<p>There is a growing side threat, the Original Amalgamate. Mirai retains many of her abilities and high-level functions from the main quest, but is reset to level 1.</p>

<p>I’m not yet clear on how or why the Original comes back, or if it does.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For this broad-strokes plot summary though, this is basically the end.</p>

<h2>Disc 4 </h2>

<p>U go and drop everyone back home, they all have little closing questlines. u fight a bunch of singularitarians who want to reincarnate the old amalgamate and have it fuse with remnants of the second amalgamate (the one u just fought) to usher in the singularity. U stop them. Mirai dies, u quest about to bring her back. In the credits, everyone goes home again, Mirai doesn’t, instead she like… literally figures out a way to incarnate herself in the real world.</p>

<p>The end.</p>
